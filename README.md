# ETL-Shopee
A step-by-step approach to extract, transform, and load data from an e-commerce website Shopee using Python and JSON.

In this project, JSON URL calls is used to extract the watches /wrist watch in Shopee because Shopee seasonally change their system, which may incur the change of selectors used and impose a higher risk towards incomplete data scraping (unable to fully scrape the desired data). Hence, JSON that will be connected to Shopee API is a faster and more dynamic tool or solution towards the aforementioned problem.
